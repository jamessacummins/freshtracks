                        Young people with a brain injury tend to get tired more quickly, have difficulty with short-term memory
                        and find
                        it difficult to concentrate. However, they often do not lose their intelligence but rather they lose their
                        ability to communicate and function physically.

                        Examples of acquired brain injuries include Multiple Sclerosis, brain tumours, strokes, traumatic brain
                        injuries
                        caused by an accident or fall or other degenerative neurological diseases.
