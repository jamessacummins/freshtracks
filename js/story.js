        "story": `Sam Carson was 27 when he fell four stories at a party, in October 2009. He suffered a
        traumatic brain injury, and doctors at Sydney’s Royal North Shore Hospital did not expect
        him to survive the night. He underwent major surgery and emerged from a coma days later.
        He was very unresponsive and could not smile or move, let alone walk or talk.
        <br><br>
        Sam’s prognosis was not good and his family was told that given his condition, with any
        improvement unlikely and not much hope for rehabilitation he would be sent to live in an aged-care facility.
        <br><br>
        But Sam showed signs of improvement before he was due to leave hospital, so two months
        after his accident was admitted to the Royal Rehabilitation Centre at North Ryde, one of
        the only facilities of its kind in New South Wales. Since then Sam has made significant
        improvements, with intensive daily rehabilitation including speech, occupational and physio therapies.
        <br><br>
        Sam has progressed to a stage where he not only recognises his family and friends but can
        also feed himself, can walk, although heavily assisted, and is showing signs of being able to talk.
        If Sam had been sent to an aged-care facility instead of the Royal Rehabilitation Centre it is almost
        certain that his condition would not have improved so remarkably, if much at all.
        <br><br>
        Sam’s life has true value and quality, yet he and his family are facing the same predicament of many
        other young people and the people that love them. There are few facilities in Australia that provide
        young Australians with an acquired brain injury a place to live where they can receive full-time care and still lead a youthful existence.
        <br><br>
        <b>The vast majority of young people with brain injury end up in aged-care facilities. This is 
            despite their largely unaffected intellectual capacity. </b>
        <br><br>
        Lack of awareness of brain injury and minimal government funding means there are currently very limited 
        alternatives to aged-care facilities for young people.`,

        "intro": `Prior to his accident, Kevin was a regular 20 year old. He was studying Exercise Physiology at the University of Sydney, 
        juggled two jobs (teaching kids how to swim and selling bicycles at a local retail store), was half way through an internship with 
        the Sydney University Rugby Club, and managed to squeeze in friends, a loving girlfriend and a passion for road cycling in between!`,
        "story": `Prior to his accident, Kevin was a regular 20 year old. He was studying Exercise Physiology at the University of Sydney, 
        juggled two jobs (teaching kids how to swim and selling bicycles at a local retail store), was half way through an internship with 
        the Sydney University Rugby Club, and managed to squeeze in friends, a loving girlfriend and a passion for road cycling in between!
        <br><br>
        On Mother’s Day in 2012, everything changed. Whilst completing his usual morning ride along Bobbin Head Road, Kevin hit a pothole 
        and came off his bike, sustaining a severe traumatic brain injury.
        <br><br>
        He had been doing everything right – he wore a helmet, had his bike regularly serviced, rode with a friend, made sure conditions 
        were good and the two weren’t going particularly fast. Kev was just in the wrong place, at the wrong time.
        <br><br>
        Kev was treated at Royal North Shore Hospital where he was put in a medically induced coma for approximately a month and underwent 
        several life-saving surgeries. From there Kev began his road to recovery at the Ryde Royal Rehab Centre, and was initially doing well 
        until a nasty infection near his brain caused him to deteriorate significantly. By the end of 2012 Kevin was unable to speak, had no working 
        memory, was unable to eat, needed to use an electric wheelchair and required 24/7 care.
        <br><br>
        Thankfully with the support of his family, and through extensive therapy and a second cranioplasty surgery, things began to pick up in
         mid 2013. He emerged from post-traumatic amnesia, begun collecting and forming new memories and started to relearn everything that had 
         been lost to him. After a year‘s worth of intensive therapy, Kevin has gone from being completely dependent on his family, to being
          independent for all activities of daily living – a major feat for any TBI survivor.
        <br><br>
        With continued support and a huge amount of effort, 2015 saw Kev achieve milestone after milestone. Highlights include completing 
        a Certificate III in Fitness at TAFE, traveling overseas with his long-term girlfriend, Robyn, and running a half marathon! Kevin 
        has even returned to the Royal Rehab Centre as a volunteer to assist the physiotherapy team run a high mobility group (the very same 
        class that got Kev back up on his feet and running).
        <br><br>
        Despite some medical setbacks, Kev plans to continue with his forward momentum and is determined to return to his Exercise Physiology degree this year, and to find employment within the fitness industry. So 2016 is guaranteed to be yet another busy year!`,

        to share their time with. Every winter on saturdays this was Steve’s one day

        "story": `Steve is a very charismatic personality, that everybody loves and enjoys 
        to share their time with. Every winter on saturdays this was Steve’s one day 
        of the week where he did the 1 thing he loved the most – playing rugby with 
        his mates. Saturday 28 Apr 2012, was  no different, a normal day of rugby!
         Steve came off the field taking a knock to his nose that rattled him enough 
         to come off for a rest. Steve did go back out and play feeling ok within himself. 
         Playing for over 13yrs Steve knew his mental and physical limits within this sport.
            <br><br>
            Later that night Steve would go out with friends and family to celebrate what
             would be his 25th bday the very next day, Sunday 29 April. The evening was a 
             fun and energetic time bouncing from local bars to dance floors and eventually
              making it home after a long night to continue his festivities with a handful 
              of family members. As night rolled into morning and Steve realised his ability
               to drink anymore was coming to an end, he took himself off to the bathroom where 
               he would later be found passed out on the tiles. Awoken by his sister who noticed
                he was incoherent (assumed by too many bday drinks) gave him plenty of water to drink
                 before moving him to the comfort of the couch to rest off his evening.
            <br><br>
            Sadly Steve didn’t wake up again on his bday Sunday. Steve had vomited in his
             sleep closing off his airways. He suffocated his brain and lungs of oxygen by 
             obstruction to his airways. Although his family did give him 1st Aid, he was revived 
             by paramedics who stabilised him to get him to hospital, where he was put in an induced coma for 3 weeks.
            <br><br>
            In this time his family learnt from Neurologists, ICU doctors and specialists that 
            a number of factors in Steves ‘normal’ saturday could have lead to the severity of his accident.
             A possible concussion from the knock to his nose at rugby and dehydration – caused by not enough 
             water and electrolytes in his body at rugby and by alcohol later in the night, meant that Steve should
              not have been out celebrating his bday. These 2 things combined required rest and stability. 
              A later recognisable bump to his head believed to have been acquired from his fall in the bathroom 
              could have caused further damage and concussion. Hence by the time he was laid to rest his brain 
              and body were not able to respond to his bodies need to clear his airways properly.
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately no-one can be certain how long Steve’s brain was starved of oxygen. Brain
             injuries happen to many people of all ages, in different ways. No single brain injury is the 
             same as the next. Everyones recovery and their capacity to recover is very individual. Since awaking 
             from his coma, recovery has been a long adventure of highs, lows, quick fixes, delays, time, 
             energy, care and mostly support. From the ICU ward of Manly hospital, to Royal ryde rehab clinic and
              moving home the need to give Steve the right age appropriate care, future living conditions and support
               is paramount for our family. Therapy on a weekly basis consists of fitness training, speech therapy, 
               computer brain training, occupational therapy and functional neurology. The support of annual private 
               fundraising events and places like FreshTracks give Steve and his family hope that one day he may be able 
               to live an independent and youthful life for himself again.
            <br><br>
            The charismatic personality of Steve that everyone loves shines on a daily basis. We are grateful 
            for Freshtracks and their efforts to give back to our brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, parents who are on their recovery journey.

        "story":`At 22 years old I had moved out of the family home in Sydney and headed for Melbourne.
        Things were going really well. I had made some good friends, was working locally and was
        living in a home with a beautiful little garden.
        <br><br>
        At the time of my stroke I was out in my garden talking to a friend.
        I usually talk extremely fast so when my friend complained that I was mumbling
        I didn’t think much of it. But when I repeated what I said it came out even more slurred.
        I tried drinking some water but couldn’t get my mouth to swallow. My friend said ‘Ok, your scaring me, something is wrong with you’.
        <br><br>
        I don’t know why but I just started to laugh.
        <br><br>
        We went inside and I was too embarrassed to talk, so I wrote it down. My friend couldn’t
        understand what I was writing. It was then that my dad and friend rushed me to the doctor.
        By this time, I was laughing hysterically.
        <br><br>
        At the doctor’s, my vision started to blur. Then I passed out.
        <br><br>
        Waking 10 days later I was in ICU wondering, what had happened?
        All my friends and family had come down from Sydney to visit me,
        as well as my friends from Melbourne. I was thinking ‘Oh my goodness,
        something really bad must have happened to me’. It turned out, that I
        had suffered a hemorrhagic to the left side of my brain.
        <br><br>
        I could not talk and was only able to communicate by giving a thumbs
        up or thumbs down with my left hand. I cried thinking ‘why me?’.
        <br><br>
        Weeks later I took my first steps and mumbled a few words. It was so
        exciting because we now knew I would talk again. I was so happy and I was
        so grateful to my mum, family and friends for their daily visits. It was such an emotional time.

        <br><br>
        Leaving hospital after 6 weeks I was moved into outpatient rehab where
        I learnt to say my first proper words…yes & no and it just got better from
        there. My walking got stronger, and I began eating solid foods. After
        another 6 weeks I moved back to Sydney with my family so they could look after me.



        <br><br>
        Continuing my rehab in Sydney my speech got better and my walking
        improved. But I still could not move my right arm or hand. I was feeling
        very dishearten because there seemed be very little hope for my hand. The
        physiotherapists at the ‘Advanced Rehab Center’ suggested a new treatment
        using a device call a Seabo glove but it was expensive.


        <br><br>
        Thankfully Fresh Tracks was able to help. They funded my therapy and
        also bought the Seabo glove which is worth $2500.<b> I am so grateful to
            Fresh Tracks and can’t thank them enough. Without their funding, my right
            hand wouldn’t have got much better </b>. The Seabo glove helps by prompting the
        damaged part of my brain to move my right hand and I am now able to pick up
        simple things like, a tennis ball. Its limited but there’s hope.


        <br><br>
        If I could say one thing to people who have had a stroke it would be,
        don’t give up! Keep working hard and even if you don’t see improvements,
        you will feel so much better knowing that you are helping your body fight
        to recover. And who knows, you just might surprised yourself.`

        "story": `  Barker old boy, Paul Isaacs was 22 when he suffered a fractured
        skull as a result of a car accident while on a skiing holiday
        in New Zealand. On a day of extreme winds, Paul was the passenger
        in a car that veered onto the gravel shoulder where upon the car
        skidded and overturned. Eventually arriving at hospital 8 hours later
        Paul was operated on for his head injuries.
        <br><br>
        In the weeks following the accident the shock to his head caused
        a build up of pressure on the brain that made breathing very difficult.
        After passing this initial hurdle Paul was transferred back to Australia
        where he spent the next four months in Royal North Shore Hospital
        in-and-out of intensive care. Then onto the Ryde Royal Rehabilitation
        Centre to begin his rehabilitation.
        <br><br>
        More than 12 months after the accident he returned home to Lindfield.
        A marvellous team of volunteers were then assembled who worked tirelessly
        with Paul to help at his home over the next 4 years. Primarily however he
        was looked after by his parents, Lyn and Kev, for the next 10 years until
        the physical demands of continual and ongoing care became too much.
        <br><br>
        Lyn and Kev were faced with the problem that there were no facilities in
        Sydney that could accommodate a young person requiring 24 hour care. As
        a compromise in 2002 Paul took up residence at Wescott Aged Care Facility
        in Stockton (near Newcastle).
        <br><br>
        It took another 10 years of living in an aged care facility before an
        opportunity arose in 2012 (through the Young People in Residential Aged Care program)
        to live in the age appropriate residential care facility called Weemala. Weemala had
        just been constructed on the Ryde Rehabilitation Centre site and is a wonderful
        facility that offers accommodation and rehabilitation facilities for young people.
        <br><br>
        From the time Paul started living at “Weemala” his physical and mental
        improvement has been considerable. He is still wheelchair bound but has
        a goal to walk which is keenly supported by the on-site rehab team.
        <br><br>
        <b>We want to thank Freshtrack so very much for their support </b> in providing
        $2000 to buy the GRAFO carbon fibre ankle and foot brace. This foot brace
        now makes Paul’s dream of walking again a real possibility.
        <br><br>
        So many years after the accident Paul now considers he is really “home”.
        At Weemala he is so happy to be close to his parents, sister, other family
        and friends who visit him regularly. From Paul’s point of view “all’s good”. `
